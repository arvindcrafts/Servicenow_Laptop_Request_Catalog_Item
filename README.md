# Servicenow Laptop Request Catalog Item

This repository contains the project documents for the development of a ServiceNow Laptop Request Catalog Item. This project aims to create a self-service catalog item in ServiceNow that will allow employees to easily request a new laptop.

## Project Goal

The primary goals of this project are to:

*   Streamline the laptop request and procurement process.
*   Improve the user experience for employees requesting laptops.
*   Automate the workflow for laptop requests, including approvals and fulfillment.
*   Provide better tracking and visibility into the status of laptop requests.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this solution is all employees within the organization who are eligible to request a laptop.

## Solution

The proposed solution is to create a new catalog item in ServiceNow. This catalog item will guide the user through the process of selecting a laptop, providing a business justification, and submitting the request for approval.

The solution will include:

*   A user-friendly interface for requesting laptops.
*   An automated approval workflow based on the employee's role and department.
*   Integration with the asset management module to track laptop inventory.
*   Notifications to keep the user informed about the status of their request.

The "Data Flow Diagrams and User Stories.pdf" file provides a more detailed description of the solution, including data flow diagrams and user stories.

## Technology Stack

The solution will be built on the ServiceNow platform. The "Technology Stack Template.pdf" file provides more details about the technology stack that will be used.

## Project Plan

The project will be executed in a phased approach, as outlined in the "Project planning.pdf" file. The plan includes the following phases:

*   Ideation
*   Requirement Analysis
*   Project Design
*   Development and Testing
*   Deployment

## Performance Testing

The performance of the solution will be tested to ensure that it can handle the expected load and that it meets the performance requirements. The "Performance Testing.pdf" file provides more details about the performance testing plan.
